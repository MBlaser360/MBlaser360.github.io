Elevator pitches: 
1) For book lovers that need help organizing books they've already read: the 'book counter' is an app that lets users keep track of books read, books currently being read, and books to read. 
2) For music lovers who need new music: the 'genre randomizer' is an app that takes a selected genre and then randomly chooses from a list of related sub-genres. Within that sub-genre would be a short list of its top artists.
3) For people who don't know what to do for a new username: the 'username-randomizer' is an app that makes a name from conjoining different entered words.
